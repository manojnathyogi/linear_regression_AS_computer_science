[1] grade threshold

A grade threshold is the minimum number of marks that a candidate needs to obtain a particular grade (a, b, c, d, e) in a subject in a particular series (may/jun OR oct/nov) which is calculated by Cambridge Assessment International Education.

[2] Percentage (%) of students achieving grade (a, b, c, d, e)

The percentage of students achieving grade (a, b, c, d, e) is calculated and published by Cambridge Assessment International Education based on the total number of students appearing the subject in a particular series (may/jun **OR** oct/nov) around the world.

[3] The relation of percentage achieveing the grade (a, b, c, d, e) with the grade threshold for each grades (a, b, c, d, e) is checked and presented in the graphs (Linear Graph).
